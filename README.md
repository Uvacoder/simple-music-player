# Music-Player
Enjoy the cool sleek look and colorful play animation.

### Created for the love of music.
Neomorphism + neomorphism waves = cool effects.

A few bugs in the code including
- Inability to seek
- Volume messes up due to the waves overlapping on it
- Music files are too heavy and won't play until you loop through the whole list
hoping to fix very soon.

And looking to add Audiomack and Spotify button as soon as I can.

*Enjoy, evaluate and critize*
